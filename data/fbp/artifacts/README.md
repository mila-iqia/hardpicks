This folder is where preprocessed data archives (in HDF5 format) will be written by the preprocessing
script (`subsurface_rock_characterization/first_break_picking_preprocess.py`) in order to fix some of
the formatting bugs in the original data. The figures used in reports will also land in this folder.

It may be beneficial to make this folder a symbolic link and locate the destination on a fast drive.
