This folder contains configuration files, preprocessed data archives, and raw data files related
to the first break picking models.

The `artifacts` directory holds HDF5 archives that are preprocessed versions of the raw site data.
The `cache` directory holds cached data loader files. The `folds` directory holds information
on the cross-validation folds used for the first break picking experiments. The `data` directory
should be a symbolic link pointing to the storage drive holding the raw site data.
