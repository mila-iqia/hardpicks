### `hardpicks.analysis` subpackage

Note that the content of this folder is not required to run training/prediction experiments. The
scripts herein are mostly used to analyze the raw data, extract statistics, or create figures to
improve our understanding. Many of the scripts are likely outdated as they have not been updated
following new versions of the datasets/corrections.

Most scripts will automatically save their figures/intermediate results in the
`ANALYSIS_RESULTS_DIR` folder defined in the
[`__init__.py` module of the package root.](../__init__.py)
