This folder contains scripts used for the analysis of first break picking model data and predictions.

Some folders of specific interest:
 - The `bad_gathers` directory holds gather cleanup scripts as well as previously generated lists of
   bad gather IDs;
 - The `mlflow_and_orion_analysis` directory holds scripts needed to aggregate and analyse experiment
   results.
 - The `report` directory holds scripts used to generate the plots and tables for the first break
   picking report; similarly, the `publication` directory holds those for the journal publication of
   the same milestone, and the `workshop` directory holds those for the Neurips workshop paper.
